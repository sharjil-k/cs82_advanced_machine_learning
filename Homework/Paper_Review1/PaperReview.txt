Title : Implementation of recurrent neural network and boosting method for time-series forecasting
Reviewed by: Amay

Critique:
The main idea of this paper is to introduce a new hyperparameter K in a boosting algorithm. 
The parameter K would determine how much subsequent boosting models would lean towards misclassified points of earlier models.
The paper itself discusses how the choice of the loss function was critical in determining the effect of variable K in model performance. 
In other words, leaning more towards the misclassified points was helpful for some loss functions but not others. Since this was the case, it would 
have been nice to see how the choice of K effects boosting algorithms using other base classifiers such as  regression models or k-nearest neighbors.
It would have been a great to see the reasults of leaning more or less towards missclassified points when other base algorithms are used for prediction.

I would have added boosting models with other weak learners and also included an ensemlbe model with no boosting in the comparisons to paint a much clearer picture of 
the effect of K in boosting algorithms.
